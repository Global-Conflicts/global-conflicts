2021 Israelâ€“Palestine crisis: The death toll from the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza increases to 137 people with more than 920 others wounded, as shellings and bombardments increase in the districts of Gaza. The Shati refugee camp is hit by bombings, resulting in the death of ten people, including eight children, thereby bringing the number of children killed to 36. The death toll in Israel rises to nine people killed, including a six-year-old boy.
