A 28-year-old white supremacist hijacks a truck in Winthrop, Massachusetts, before crashing into an unoccupied home, causing extensive damage. He then fails to hijack another vehicle, then opening fire on black bystanders, killing a woman and a man. Police exchange gunfire with the attacker, killing him at the scene. White supremacist rhetoric is found in the gunman's handwriting. (BBC)
