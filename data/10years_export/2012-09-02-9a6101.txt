Syrian civil war: A car bomb attack by unknown people near a Palestinian refugee camp in the Damascene suburb of Sbeineh (Sabina) kills at least 15 people. AFP says rebels claim the capture of the village of Harem near Idlib on the Turkish border, after a 3-day siege; the government still keeps air supremacy. U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi says it is both conflict parties' duty to try to reach peace. (Bloomberg via Business Week) (The Daily Star)
