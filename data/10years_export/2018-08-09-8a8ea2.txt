Yemeni Civil War (2015â€“present): At least 43 people, mostly children, are killed in an airstrike on a bus at a market in Dahyan, Sa'da, by the Saudi-led coalition, while more than 60 are injured. The coalition calls the strike a "legitimate military action" against the Houthis, accusing them of using children as human shields. (The Guardian)
