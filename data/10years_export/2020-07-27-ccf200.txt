Mali War: ECOWAS demands the release of Malian opposition leader Soumaila Cissé, who was kidnapped in March just days before a disputed election, asks 31 elected MPs whose results were disputed to resign, and requests an urgent inquiry into protesters' deaths on 10–12 July. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta is given ten days to respond to the bloc's proposals or face sanctions. (BBC)
