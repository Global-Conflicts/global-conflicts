Tigray military intervention: State-affiliated TV reports that Ethiopian Armed Forces have seized Humera Airport in the Tigray Region. Hundreds have been killed since the intervention broke out last week as the African Union calls for an immediate end to the conflict. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered airstrikes and an offensive after an alleged attack on a federal military base by forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front. (Reuters)
