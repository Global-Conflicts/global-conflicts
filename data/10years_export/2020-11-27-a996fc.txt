Tigray conflict: Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed rejects talks with the leadership of the Tigray People's Liberation Front but says he is willing to talk to representatives "operating legally". The meeting with African Union (AU) representatives Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa, comes after his announcement of a "final phase" of an offensive on the region's capital Mekelle.
