Guantanamo Files: (The Guardian) (WikiLeaks) (Al Jazeera): Staff at Guant√°namo Bay were instructed that any Muslim traveling to Afghanistan after 11 September 2001 was likely to have gone there "to support Osama bin Laden through direct hostilities against the US forces", with any other reasons being dismissed as "total fabrications", making it difficult for the interrogated to plead their innocence.
