Tigray military intervention: Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed orders a "military response" to "subdue authorities in Tigray Region" and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) following an alleged attack on a federal military base that resulted in multiple casualties. Abiy says that the "last red line has been crossed". Later in the day, federal troops enter the region and heavy fighting is reported. (BBC) (Reuters)
