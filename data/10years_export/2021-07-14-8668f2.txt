War in Afghanistan: Taliban insurgency: 2021 Taliban offensive: The Taliban claims to have captured the strategic city of Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province, on the border with Pakistan. One of the group's spokesmen, Zabihullah Mujahid, says that the city was "under mujahideen control". Pakistan confirms the capture, saying that the Taliban removed the Afghan flag and raised theirs. The Afghan Ministry of Defense says that they were checking information. If this is confirmed by the Afghan government, it would be the latest territorial gain by the armed group. (DW)
