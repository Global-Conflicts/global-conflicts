Kyrgyzstan's security forces storm the compound of former President Almazbek Atambayev on the outskirts of Bishkek for the second time after a failed overnight raid left one officer dead. Atambayev and his loyalists are "putting up severe armed resistance", according to President Sooronbay Jeenbekov. Atambayev is detained, ending a two-day standoff. One officer was killed, while 80 people were injured. (Reuters) (BBC)
