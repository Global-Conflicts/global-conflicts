Tigray conflict: The Tigray People's Liberation Front forces claim that they have destroyed an Ethiopian National Defense Force division. The Ethiopian government denies this and claims that many Tigrayan fighters are surrendering as the 72-hour ultimatum previously issued by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is approaching its end and a military build-up is growing around the region's capital, Mekelle.
