Tigray War: Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed calls on "all eligible citizens" to join the armed forces to "stop the Tigray forces once and for all" and for all Ethiopians to "show patriotism" in this moment. Abiy had promised a swift victory when the war broke out in late 2020, but this changed in June when Tigrayan forces recaptured the region and advanced further into other regions. (Al Jazeera English)
