Members of Ireland's police force Garda Síochána raid the Dublin home of former MEP Paul Murphy TD, taking Murphy into custody along with three other activists and politicians opposing the water-tax-rate change, stirring nationwide speculation of "political policing." The police later release all four without charges. (Independent.IE) (The Irish Times) (The Irish Times)
