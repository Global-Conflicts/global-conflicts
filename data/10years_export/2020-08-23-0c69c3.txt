Second Libyan Civil War: A spokesman for Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) rejects a ceasefire proposed by the Government of National Accord (GNA) and says it is a "marketing stunt". He says GNA forces are mobilising in different fronts in the country and the LNA will defend from any attack on its positions around Sirte and Jufra. Yesterday, the High Council of State, which advises the GNA, rejected dialogue with Haftar. (Al Jazeera)
