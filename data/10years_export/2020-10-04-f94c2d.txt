Terrorism in Germany, Antisemitism in 21st century Germany: Amid the celebration of Sukkot, a 26-year-old Jewish student suffers a traumatic brain injury after being attacked with a shovel by a 29-year-old German Kazakh man as he entered a synagogue in Hamburg. Police later discover a piece of paper with a swastika on it in one of the attacker's trouser pockets. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas denounces the attack as "repugnant antisemitism".
