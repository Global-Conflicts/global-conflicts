A propaganda video featuring Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is released, in which he references the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, indicating that he is still alive and that the video was shot very recently. It is the first time he's been seen on video since July 2014, when he addressed a crowd at the now destroyed Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul. (Al Jazeera)
