2021 Myanmar protests: Security forces kill at least 54 anti-coup protesters in several cities, thirty-seven of whom were in Yangon. A policeman is also killed. It is the protests' deadliest day. The civilian Vice President, Mahn Win Khaing Than, says that they will pass legislation to "give people the right to defend themselves against the military" and calls for a "revolution" to overthrow the junta. Meanwhile, a junta spokesman labels the protesters as "criminals" but refuses to elaborate. (BBC)
