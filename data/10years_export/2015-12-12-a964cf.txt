2015 Burundian unrest: Burundi's army reports 87 people, including eight government defenders, were killed, and 45 attackers captured in Friday's clashes at three military sites in Bujumbura. Police have not identified the gunmen. Witnesses report some of the victims'  arms were tied behind their backs while others were killed at close range. This was the worst violence since this spring's attempted coup d'Ã©tat. One of the generals behind the failed coup says his rebel group still wants to oust the president.
