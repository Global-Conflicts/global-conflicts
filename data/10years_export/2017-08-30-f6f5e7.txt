Syrian Civil War: American-led intervention in Syria: CJTF–OIR jets destroy a section of road, blocking the path of a convoy carrying ISIL evacuees from the Lebanon–Syria border en route to Abu Kamal in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. The convoy, carrying 308 militants and 331 civilians according to Hezbollah, is now effectively stranded in Syrian government-controlled territory. (Reuters)
