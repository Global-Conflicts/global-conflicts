Second Libyan Civil War: An investigation by the BBC into the involvement of the Russian Wagner Group in the war reveals that the group committed several war crimes, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war and civilians and the leaving of unmarked mines in civilian areas. The investigation also finds that Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was involved in the group's operations, and that the group likely received weapons and supplies from the Russian military.
