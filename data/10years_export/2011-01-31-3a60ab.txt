2011 Egyptian protests: President Hosni Mubarak orders his new prime minister Ahmed Shafiq to preserve subsidies, control inflation and provide more jobs as he battles an intense popular revolt against his 30-year rule. The announcement is read out on state television but has little effect as protesters vow to continue demonstrating until the Mubarak regime falls. (Al Jazeera) (AFP via The Sydney Morning Herald)
