Tigray War: Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed admits for the first time that Eritrean troops entered Ethiopia's Tigray Region and fought the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front, and that they may have been involved in war crimes. Abiy says that Eritrean forces promised to leave the region as soon as Ethiopia's military was able to "control the border". (Al Jazeera)
