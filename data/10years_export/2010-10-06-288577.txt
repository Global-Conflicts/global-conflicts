Gunmen torch up to 40 oil tanker trucks carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan in Quetta and Nowshera, Pakistan  and kill a truck driver. The Tehreek-e-Taliban claimed responsibility for that and other attacks. This was the sixth attack on convoys taking supplies to Afghanistan since Pakistan closed a key border crossing almost a week ago.  (AP via MSNBC) (Reuters), (AFP via Google News) (Sky News) (Reuters)
