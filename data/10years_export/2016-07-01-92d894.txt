Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict:  In response to violence in the Hebron area, including the killing yesterday of a 13-year-old Jewish girl asleep in her home in the  Kiryat Arba settlement by a Palestinian assailant, the Israel Defense Forces places a closure on Hebron, brings additional troops to the area  and announces a cut to tax funds it collects for the Palestinian Authority, saying it would deduct the amount the Palestinian leadership pays to the families of militants.
