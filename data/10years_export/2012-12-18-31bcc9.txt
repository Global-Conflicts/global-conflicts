2012 Central African Republic rebellion: A coalition of rebel groups called Seleka take over the Central African Republic mining town of Bria, killing at least 15 government soldiers. The group is spearheaded by UFDR forces and has already taken five towns in its two-week offensive, which it claims is because of a lack of progress after a peace deal ended the 2004–2007 Bush War. Following an appeal for help from President François Bozizé, the President of Chad Idriss Déby sends 20 vehicles of heavily armed troops to help quell the rebellion. (ABC News) (AFP) (Reuters)
