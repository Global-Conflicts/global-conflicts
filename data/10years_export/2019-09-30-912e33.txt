Somali Civil War: Islamist militants launch two attacks against foreign forces in Somalia. A U.S. military base in Baledogle, Lower Shabelle, is stormed by attackers using two car bombs and guns, and an Italian peacekeeping convoy is targeted by additional bombs in Mogadishu. United States and Italian authorities both state no injuries occurred, although the suicide bombing against the Italian convoy destroyed a military vehicle and heavily damaged nearby buildings. Al-Shabaab claims responsibility for both attacks. (Newsweek)
