The United Nations human rights office says that Myanmar has been carrying out daily airstrikes in Rakhine and Chin states and that at least 32 civilians (mostly women and children) have been killed since March 23. The Arakan Army unilaterally declared a month-long ceasefire to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but the military rejected the ceasefire saying a previous ceasefire had not been respected by the insurgents.
