2015 Ankara bombings: Ankara's Chief Prosecutor's office says it has "strong evidence" that an Islamic State group — based in Gaziantep, near the Syrian border — is behind the bombings at this month's Ankara peace rally that killed 102 people, as well as  four previous attacks in Turkey since May that have mainly targeted supporters of a pro-Kurdish party.
