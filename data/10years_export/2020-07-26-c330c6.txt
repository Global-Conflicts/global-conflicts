Afghan peace process: The Taliban accuse the government of re-capturing freed Taliban prisoners, a claim Kabul denies as "incorrect". A Taliban spokesman tells the government to "bear responsibility for the consequences", as fears grow that some of the prisoners are returning to the battlefield. As part of the peace process, the government has freed around 5,000 prisoners. (CNA)
