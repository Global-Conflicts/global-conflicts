Colombian conflict: Three massacres kill 28 people, in Arauca, Cauca, and Nari√±o. These complete a week with five massacres, adding up to more than 33 this year. Gangs are believed to be responsible for nearly 80 percent of massacres in Colombia this year, the vast majority of them occurring in departments with illegal coca-producing enclaves.
