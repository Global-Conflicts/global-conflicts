Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown: Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan warns everyone to "respect the right of Turkey to defend its borders," says that the reason why worse incidents have not taken place in the past regarding Syria is because of the "cool-headedness of Turkey" and stresses that Turkey's actions are fully in line with the new rules of engagement that the country adopted after Syria shot down a Turkish jet in 2012.
