Syrian civil war, Northwestern Syria offensive (November 2019–present), Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War: Syrian Army shelling kills Turkish military personnel in Idlib Governorate, prompting retaliation by Turkish forces. A pro-opposition war monitor says the Turkish retaliation killed 13 Syrian soldiers, which Syria denies. The Russian Ministry of Defence says Turkey moved troops "inside the de-escalation zone [...] without notifying the Russian side". Turkish President Erdoğan says the Syrian shelling killed five Turkish soldiers and three civilian personnel, with nine others injured, and that the Russians "need to stand aside".
