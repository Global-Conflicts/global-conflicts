2019 Ecuadorian protests: Anti-government protesters parade captured police officers in the Ecuadorian capital Quito, which is de facto under the control of protesters and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador. The officers were not harmed, though they were forced to address a large crowd calling on President Len√≠n Moreno to step down, which was broadcast live by several private broadcasters after being ordered to do so by indigenous leaders.
