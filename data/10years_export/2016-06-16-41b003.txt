Syrian Civil War: Dozens of American diplomats send  a memo, via the State Departmentâ€™s dissent channel, critical of U.S. policy in Syria. The memo was signed by 51 mid- to high-level State Department officers involved with advising on Syrian policy, and calls for airstrikes against President Bashar al-Assad's government to stop its persistent violations of the United Nations-sponsored February ceasefire.
