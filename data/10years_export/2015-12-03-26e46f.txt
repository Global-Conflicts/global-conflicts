Iraqi Civil War (2014-present), American-led intervention in Iraq: Following the Obama Administration's pledge of additional Special Operations troops to Iraq, several members of Iraqâ€™s ruling alliance state that only the Iraqi Parliament can authorize the action, and political associates of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi report such a troop expansion would be unacceptable. Several members of Iraqi militias have also decried a deployment of more U.S. troops. During the pull out from Iraq, president Obama promised there would be no more "boots on the ground" in Iraq again. (Reuters)
