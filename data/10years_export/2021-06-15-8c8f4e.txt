2021 Myanmar protests: The anti-coup militia group Karenni National Defence Force announces that it has stopped its operations against the Burmese military following pleas by civilians residing in the areas they operate in, which have seen 100,000 civilians displaced. The group says that it will continue its opposition to the military junta through other means. Additionally, deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi appears in court for the second day, and was reported to be in "better condition". (Reuters)
