Tigray conflict: Federal troops seize the town of Shire Inda Selassie from the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) as government forces advance on the Tigray Region's capital Mekelle. There are conflicting reports of the status of Axum, with both sides claiming to control the town. TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael says his forces will never surrender and calls on all Tigrayans, including children, to mobilize and take up arms. (BBC) (Reuters)
