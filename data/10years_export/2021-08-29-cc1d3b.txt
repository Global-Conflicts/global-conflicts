Syrian civil war: 2021 Daraa clashes: The army bombards the last rebel enclave in the southern city of Daraa, killing six people. The army declined to comment but released a statement saying that it was losing patience with what it called "armed groups and terrorists". The site of the bombing is the birthplace of the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad which marked the start of the war. (Reuters)
