Afar–Somali clashes: According to the government of Ethiopia's Somali Region, militants from the Afar Region attack for the fourth day the Somali town of Garbaiisa, killing up to 300 people. In response, protesters set up roadblocks along a highway leading to Djibouti and damaged parts of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway, threatening Ethiopia's economy. This comes after multiple days of fighting between Afar and Somali militants in Garbaiisa. (Reuters) (Bloomberg)
