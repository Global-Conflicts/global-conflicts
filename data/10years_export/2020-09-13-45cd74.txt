Islamic terrorism in Europe: A Portuguese man is stabbed to death during a suspected jihadist attack in Morges, Switzerland. The victim was chosen at random, as the attacker entered a shop and stabbed him. The suspect had been known to the Federal Intelligence Service since 2017 for dissemination of jihadist propaganda and had been arrested in April 2019 following an arson attack. (Swissinfo)
