Arab Spring: 2011 Egyptian revolution: Scuffles in court (as families reportedly yell "Butcher! Butcher!") lead to the postponement of the trial of Hosni Mubarak's former interior minister Habib el-Adly and six others after "three or four minutes". Habib el-Adly is accused of massacring people who demonstrated against the Mubarak regime, prior to its downfall as a result of a popular revolution in February 2011. (Al Jazeera)
