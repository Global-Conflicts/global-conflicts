Tigray military intervention: Amnesty International reports that massacres are taking place in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia after a conflict broke out last week. Amnesty cites witnesses blaming the Tigray People's Liberation Front for the "horrific tragedy" taking place as airstrikes continue to hit the region after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed blamed the political group of committing war crimes. Amnesty's report could not identify the perpetrators of the massacres. (Reuters)
