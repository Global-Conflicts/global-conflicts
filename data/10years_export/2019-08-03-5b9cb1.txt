2019 El Paso shooting: At least 22 people are killed and 24 others injured in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. A suspect Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas was captured alive. The case is being investigated as domestic terrorism given that Patrick Crusius had posted a 4-page white nationalist manifesto titled The Inconvenient Truth on 8chan where he cited a supposed "Hispanic invasion of Texas" and "Simply trying to defend my country from cultural and ethnic replacement" as motivation for the shooting. The suspect was also inspired by Brenton Tarrant, the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand. (CNN)
