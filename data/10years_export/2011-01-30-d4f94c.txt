2011 Egyptian protests: Egypt's information minister cancels licenses and accreditation of staff working for the Al Jazeera international news network. The network's Cairo bureau office is to be shut down by the Egyptian government. An Al Jazeera spokesman describes the move as "an act designed to stifle and repress the freedom of reporting by the network and its journalists".
