War in Afghanistan: Taliban insurgency: 2021 Taliban offensive: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that United Nations reports of civilian deaths in Afghanistan are "deeply, deeply troubling" as the Taliban gains vital border crossings and territory. The armed group has said that, if they return to power, they will treat civilians well and will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for international terrorism. (Reuters)
