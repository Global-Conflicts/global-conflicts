2021 Myanmar protests: Security forces open fire on anti-coup protesters, killing 15 people and wounding dozens more. A Chinese-owned garment factory in Yangon is also set on fire by a mob. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says that the junta appears to be shifting its focus from the cities to rural areas, and is "losing control" of the country. (Reuters)
