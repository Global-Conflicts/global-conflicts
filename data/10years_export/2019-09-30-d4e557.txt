The Swedish Navy formally relocates its headquarters back to the underground Muskö naval base on the island of Muskö after a 25-year absence. The move from Karlskrona naval base to Muskö is based on the calculation that only Muskö could withstand a Russian attack, according to the Swedish Defence Research Agency. (The Guardian)
