Tigray conflict: Mekelle offensive: The Ethiopian National Defense Force says it will begin a "final phase" of an offensive on the Tigray People's Liberation Front-held city of Mekelle in the Tigray Region, following the expiration of a 72-hour ultimatum for Tigrayan forces to surrender. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed calls on the people of Mekelle to "disarm, stay at home and stay away from military targets" during the military operation. (Reuters)
