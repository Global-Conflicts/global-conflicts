Syrian Civil War: According to the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, ISIL has undertaken several attacks on Syrian positions from U.S.-controlled areas, implying that the recent well-coordinated actions of the terrorists indicate that they somehow possess intelligence data that could only be obtained as a result of air reconnaissance.
