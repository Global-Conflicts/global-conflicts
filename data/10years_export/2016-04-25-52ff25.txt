Moro conflict:  Abu Sayyaf militants, who threatened to kill three foreigners kidnapped from a "high-end" Philippine resort in September 2015, unless they were paid 900 million pesos (17 mil Euros) by midnight today (15:00 UTC), have beheaded one of the hostages, Canadian John Ridsdel. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III  had ordered an all-out effort to rescue the hostages, including a Philippine woman, kidnapped  by the Daesh-linked group.
