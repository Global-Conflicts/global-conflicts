Iran's most senior nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, is assassinated by gunmen in Absard. The attackers blow up a car and then open fire on his vehicle, seriously wounding him; he later dies in a hospital. Three or four of the attackers are later killed during a gunfight with Fakhrizadeh's bodyguards. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has called the killing an act of state terror. (BBC)
