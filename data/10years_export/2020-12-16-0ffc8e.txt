2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war: Dozens of Artsakh Defence Army troops are reportedly captured during an Azerbaijani "anti-terror" raid on several villages in Nagorno-Karabakh. The villages had previously been returned to Azerbaijan as part of the 2020 ceasefire agreement. Artsakh's Defence Ministry says that it "lost contact" with a number of military posts overnight, with as many as 60 to 160 personnel missing. Videos uploaded to social media appear to show captured soldiers. (BBC)
