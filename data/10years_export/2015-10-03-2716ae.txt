Syrian Civil War, Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War: British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon says only five percent of Russia's airstrikes in Syria have targeted Islamic State extremists. Instead, other Syrian rebel groups, including the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, have been attacked. "Our evidence indicates they are dropping unguided munitions in civilian areas, killing civilians," Fallon added. (Voice of America), (Reuters)
