War in Afghanistan: 2021 Afghanistan attacks: With multiple electricity pylons near Kabul being destroyed by bomb blasts, electricity supplier Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) is reporting a shortage of 530 megawatts of power and announced that it will take 20 days to repair the destroyed pylons. Residents are accusing DABS of discrimination during these outages, as the capital's elite had 24-hour electricity. (TOLO News)
