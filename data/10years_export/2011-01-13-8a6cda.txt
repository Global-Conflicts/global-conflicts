Protests in Tunisia: President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali gives a televised address during which he attempts to appease protesters by vowing not to seek re-election in 2014. He also promises an end to live firing of "real bullets": three more people are killed in the Tunis suburb of Aouina less than an hour later. (Al Jazeera) (BBC) (The Guardian)
