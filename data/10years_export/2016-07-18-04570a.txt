Indonesian police kill two militants in a clash in a remote jungle area on Sulawesi island. One may be Abu Wardah Santoso, leader of ISIL-connected Mujahidin Indonesia Timur, and the country's "most wanted man."  Forensic tests will be carried out. Three others, including two women, escaped. (AP) (Reuters via Euronews)
