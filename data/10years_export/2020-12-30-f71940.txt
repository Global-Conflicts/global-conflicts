Yemeni Civil War: 2020 Aden attacks: At least 25 people are killed and more than 110 others wounded in an attack at the Aden International Airport, shortly after a plane carrying the newly formed government arrived from Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed is taken to safety along with the Saudi ambassador and all remaining government members. The Houthis are blamed for the attack, but the group has denied responsibility. Another blast was later reported at the presidential palace, where the cabinet was meeting. (The Washington Post)
