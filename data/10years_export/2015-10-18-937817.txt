Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict (2015): The Israeli military evacuated dozens of Jewish worshippers  who were surrounded by Palestinians after entering Joseph's Tomb compound in Nablus, which was recently torched by Palestinians. The area is under full Palestinian control but Jewish prayer is permitted there when coordinated with authorities. The military said Sunday's visit was not, and the worshippers had no permit.
