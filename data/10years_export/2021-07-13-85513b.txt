War in Afghanistan: Taliban insurgency: 2021 Taliban offensive: The Taliban say that they do not want to take their "fight in the mountains and deserts to infighting in cities" but warn against failed attempts at negotiations as the group advances in the country. The Taliban also condemns Turkey for sending protection to Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport as part of a "violation of sovereignty" which they labeled as "reprehensible". (Al Jazeera)
